# Meteor

Meteor is a packaging and deployment tool for the Jadu Continuum platform.

## Installation

All Continuum product packages will have a Phar archive of Meteor bundled within, however when deploying custom code
it may be beneficial to also use Meteor to create packages.

[Download the Phar archive from GitHub](https://github.com/jadu/meteor/releases/latest)
